# What Am I Learning in 2020

What you see below are a list of things I aspired to learn in 2020. The confidence level tiers are not perfect since I wrote them in 10 minutes will probably change them over time. 

It does, however, track fairly accurately what my learning progression looks like whenever I pick up a new piece of technology.

## Confidence Level
1: Baby Steps

2: Writing a simple application with constant guidance to reference material 

3: Ability to piece together a full application while looking at sample projects on Github

4: Confidence with language/library/framework + able to write end-to-end tests without guidance.

5: Decent enough command to articulate various architectural trade-offs, gotchas, etc.
